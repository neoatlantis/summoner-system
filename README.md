Summoner System
===============

This is a tiny system to be placed on your blog. It allows visitor talking to
you directly and instantly.

The visitor's session and words will be handled by SocketIO. At the server,
the SocketIO server proxies these session to you via XMPP. You just have to
keep your XMPP desktop client online.

To adopt this system, you need both a server supporting NodeJS, and a blog or a
website whose source code is under you administration.
